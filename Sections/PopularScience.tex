This text should be a popular science text, that is, directed to readers with no college education in bioinformatics or molecular biotechnology. This means you cannot use your usual abstract, but you must write with simpler words, avoid overly complicated sentences and even avoid - or explain - scientific terms that are not widely known by people in general. In many cases you can also write a more popular science adapted title, instead of the more scientific on of your report. You often need to reduce/select the content, avoiding too many details, and instead pick out the most important results or "highlights" from your studies.
The summary can be 1-2 pages. The main text should be adjusted to the left and Times New Roman 12 points is an appropriate font. The title and your name should be centred and made larger than the main text. It is not allowed to include pictures. Please note that the Swedish-speaking students are required to write this summary in Swedish. If you are not fluent in Swedish, you should write in English.
Some formal, general, information should be added to the bottom of the page in the same way as on the front of your report, and will vary with the type and length of your thesis. Use the automatically generated text from the front of the report as a template (see example below).



The table of contents should be placed on a right-hand side (odd page) in the document.
