	abstract = {Bacteria pose unique challenges for genome-wide association studies because of strong structuring into distinct strains and substantial linkage disequilibrium across the genome1,2. Although methods developed for human studies can correct for strain structure3,4, this risks considerable loss-of-power because genetic differences between strains often contribute substantial phenotypic variability5. Here, we propose a new method that captures lineage-level associations even when locus-specific associations cannot be fine-mapped. We demonstrate its ability to detect genes and genetic variants underlying resistance to 17 antimicrobials in 3,144 isolates from four taxonomically diverse clonal and recombining bacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Strong selection, recombination and penetrance confer high power to recover known antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and reveal a candidate association between the outer membrane porin nmpC and cefazolin resistance in E. coli. Hence, our method pinpoints locus-specific effects where possible and boosts power by detecting lineage-level differences when fine-mapping is intractable.},

These SNPs were primarily discovered by two projects: The SNP Consortium and the analysis of clone overlaps by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. The map integrates all publicly available SNPs with described genes and other genomic features. We estimate that 60,000 SNPs fall within exon (coding and untranslated regions), and 85\% of exons are within 5 kb of the nearest SNP. Nucleotide diversity varies greatly across the genome, in a manner broadly consistent with a standard population genetic model of human history. This high-density SNP map provides a public resource for defining haplotype variation across the genome, and should help to identify biomedically important genes for diagnosis and therapy.},

	abstract = {Bacterial genomes vary extensively in terms of both gene content and gene sequence. This plasticity hampers the use of traditional SNP-based methods for identifying all genetic associations with phenotypic variation. Here we introduce a computationally scalable and widely applicable statistical method (SEER) for the identification of sequence elements that are significantly enriched in a phenotype of interest. SEER is applicable to tens of thousands of genomes by counting variable-length k-mers using a distributed string-mining algorithm. Robust options are provided for association analysis that also correct for the clonal population structure of bacteria. Using large collections of genomes of the major human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SEER identifies relevant previously characterized resistance determinants for several antibiotics and discovers potential novel factors related to the invasiveness of S. pyogenes. We thus demonstrate that our method can answer important biologically and medically relevant questions.},

	abstract = {The phenotypic effects of genetic polymorphisms often depend on the genetic and environmental context. Here, we explore how polymorphic loci in large interaction networks contribute to complex trait variation and in particular how genetic effects and network topologies are influenced by environmental perturbations. This was done by reanalysing a dataset of \&gt;4,000 haploid yeast segregants grown on 20 different media. In total, 130 epistatic loci were associated with growth in at least one environment. The across-environment interaction network defined by these loci explained 69 - 100\% of the narrow sense heritability in the individual environments. Environmental changes often resulted in network hubs being connected and disconnected from their interactors, leading to changes in additive effects of individual loci, epistatic effects of multi-locus interactions and the total level of genetic variance in growth. The largest variation in genetic effects across environments was found for epistatic loci that were highly connected network hubs in some environments but not in others. In environments where loci were highly connected, the segregating alleles epistatically suppressed or released genetic effects from their interactors. In environments where they were lowly connected, the same alleles made small or no contributions to growth. Hub-loci thus often serve as modulators, influencing the phenotypic effects of environmentally specific sets of interacting effector genes, rather than being effectors themselves. These findings illustrate the importance of the interplay between large genetic interactions networks and the living environment, both for individual phenotypes and population level metrics of genetic variation.},
