	abstract = {Background The composition of the intestinal microﬂora has been proposed as an important factor in the development of inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Antibiotics have the potential to alter the composition of the intestinal microﬂora. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential association between use of antibiotics and IBD in childhood.
Methods A nationwide cohort study was conducted of all Danish singleton children born from 1995 to 2003 (N¼577 627) with individual-level information on ﬁlled antibiotic prescriptions, IBD and potential confounding variables. Using Poisson regression, rate ratios (RRs) of IBD were calculated according to antibiotic use. Antibiotic use was classiﬁed according to time since use, type, number of courses used and age at use.
Results IBD was diagnosed in 117 children during 3 173 117 person-years of follow-up. The RR of IBD was 1.84 (95\% CI 1.08 to 3.15) for antibiotic users compared with non-users. This association appeared to be an effect on Crohn’s disease (CD) alone (RR 3.41) and was strongest in the ﬁrst 3 months following use (RR 4.43) and among children with \$7 courses of antibiotics (RR 7.32).
Conclusions Antibiotic use is common in childhood and its potential as an environmental risk factor for IBD warrants scrutiny. This is the ﬁrst prospective study to show a strong association between antibiotic use and CD in childhood. However, as with any observational study, causality cannot be inferred from our results and confounding by indicationdin particular, prescribing of antibiotics to children with intestinal symptoms of as yet undiagnosed CDdshould also be considered as a possible explanation.},

We found a highly significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G{\textgreater}A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

Disease association of rs2241880 in the autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (ATG16L1) was replicated in these samples (P = 4.0 x 10(-8)) and confirmed in a UK case-control sample (P = 0.0004). By haplotype and regression analysis, we found that marker rs2241880, a coding SNP (T300A), carries virtually all the disease risk exerted by the ATG16L1 locus. The ATG16L1 gene encodes a protein in the autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria. We found a statistically significant interaction with respect to Crohn disease risk between rs2241880 and the established CARD15 susceptibility variants (P = 0.039). Together with the lack of association between rs2241880 and ulcerative colitis (P {\textgreater} 0.4), these data suggest that the underlying biological process may be specific to Crohn disease.},

METHODS: The effects of infusion of intestinal luminal contents into excluded ileum in 3 patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone a curative ileocolonic resection with ileocolonic anastomosis and temporary protective proximal loop ileostomy were studied by histopathology and electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Contact with intestinal fluids for 8 days induced focal infiltration of mononuclear cells, eosinophils, and polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria, small vessels, and epithelium in the excluded neoterminal ileum that was previously normal. Epithelial HLA-DR expression increased, and mononuclear cells expressed the KP-1 antigen associated with activation. Marked up-regulation of RFD-7, RFD-9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 was observed after infusion, reflecting epithelioid transformation and transendothelial lymphocyte recruitment. At the ultrastructural level, dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus occurred in epithelial cells, where also basally located transport vesicles were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal contents trigger postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease in the terminal ileum proximal to the ileocolonic anastomosis in the first days after surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: We aimed to discern the relative risk for several chronic inflammatory conditions in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease.
METHODS: We used the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Database that includes longitudinal files on all patients from all health system contacts identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes for visit diagnosis. From the provincial database we extracted a control cohort matching the IBD patients 10:1 by age, sex, and geography. We considered a potential comorbid disease to be present if the patient had 5 or more health system contacts for that diagnosis. The comorbid disease period prevalence was analyzed separately for patients with UC and Crohn's disease and a prevalence ratio was calculated comparing the IBD populations with the matched cohort.
RESULTS: There were 8072 cases of IBD from 1984 to 2003, including UC (n = 3879) and Crohn's disease (n = 4193). There was a mean of approximately 16 person-years of coverage for both patients and control patients. Both UC and Crohn's disease patients had a significantly greater likelihood of having arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, psoriasis, and pericarditis than population controls. An increased risk for chronic renal disease and multiple sclerosis was noted in UC but not Crohn's disease patients. The most common nonintestinal comorbidities identified were arthritis and asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of asthma as the most common comorbidity increased in Crohn's disease patients compared with the general population is novel. These may be diseases with common causes or complications of one disease that lead to the presentation with another. Studies such as this should encourage further research into the common triggers in the organ systems that lead to autoimmune diseases.},

	abstract = {The key role of interleukin (IL)-23 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders is supported by the identification of IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) susceptibility alleles associated with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. IL-23-driven inflammation has primarily been linked to the actions of T-helper type 17 (TH17) cells. Somewhat overlooked, IL-23 also has inflammatory effects on innate immune cells and can drive T-cell-independent colitis. However, the downstream cellular and molecular pathways involved in this innate intestinal inflammatory response are poorly characterized. Here we show that bacteria-driven innate colitis is associated with an increased production of IL-17 and interferon-gamma in the colon. Stimulation of colonic leukocytes with IL-23 induced the production of IL-17 and interferon-gamma exclusively by innate lymphoid cells expressing Thy1, stem cell antigen 1 (SCA-1), retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat and IL-23R, and these cells markedly accumulated in the inflamed colon. IL-23-responsive innate intestinal cells are also a feature of T-cell-dependent models of colitis. The transcription factor ROR-gammat, which controls IL-23R expression, has a functional role, because Rag-/-Rorc-/- mice failed to develop innate colitis. Last, depletion of Thy1+ innate lymphoid cells completely abrogated acute and chronic innate colitis. These results identify a previously unrecognized IL-23-responsive innate lymphoid population that mediates intestinal immune pathology and may therefore represent a target in inflammatory bowel disease.},

Although their exact etiologies remain uncertain, results from research in animal models, human genetics, basic science and clinical trials have provided important new insights into the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated, intestinal inflammation. These studies indicate that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are heterogeneous diseases characterized by various genetic abnormalities that lead to overly aggressive T-cell responses to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. The onset and reactivation of disease are triggered by environmental factors that transiently break the mucosal barrier, stimulate immune responses or alter the balance between beneficial and pathogenic enteric bacteria. Different genetic abnormalities can lead to similar disease phenotypes; these genetic changes can be broadly characterized as causing defects in mucosal barrier function, immunoregulation or bacterial clearance. These new insights will help develop better diagnostic approaches that identify clinically important subsets of patients for whom the natural history of disease and response to treatment are predictable.},

	abstract = {Commensal bacteria in the lower intestine of mammals are 10 times as numerous as the body's cells. We investigated the relative importance of different immune mechanisms in limiting the spread of the intestinal microbiota. Here, we reveal a flexible continuum between innate and adaptive immune function in containing commensal microbes. Mice deficient in critical innate immune functions such as Toll-like receptor signaling or oxidative burst production spontaneously produce high-titer serum antibodies against their commensal microbiota. These antibody responses are functionally essential to maintain host-commensal mutualism in vivo in the face of innate immune deficiency. Spontaneous hyper-activation of adaptive immunity against the intestinal microbiota, secondary to innate immune deficiency, may clarify the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory diseases where immune dysfunction is implicated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: TNF-alpha and IL-1 have been associated with mucosal inflammation in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Innate immune defects have been associated with CD, specifically CARD15/NOD2. Recently, Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) signaling has been shown to enhance generation of both cytokines. Interestingly, TLR8 is located on the X chromosome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been associated with abnormalities of the X chromosome. The aim was to test whether TLR8 haplotypes are associated with IBD.
METHODS: Subjects (735 CD, 343 UC, 245 controls) were genotyped. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen to tag common Caucasian haplotypes.
RESULTS: Both "risk (H4)" and "protective (H1)" TLR8 haplotypes were observed associated with CD in females. Eighteen percent of CD females had H4 compared with 9\% of controls (P = 0.02). Fifty-nine percent of CD females had H1 compared with 72\% of controls (P = 0.01). H1 was also negatively associated with UC in females (59\% of UC, 72\% of controls P = 0.03). Diplotype analysis of CD, UC, and all IBD in females revealed that 2 protective haplotypes (H1/H1) had a markedly diminished odds ratio, 0.4-0.5. The presence of a risk haplotype (H4 / not H1) had a significantly increased odds ratio, 2.0-2.2. Thus, the risk for IBD was 4-5 times higher in females with 1 risk haplotype than with the protective/protective diplotype.
CONCLUSIONS: TLR8 is an X-linked IBD susceptibility gene with both common predisposing and protecting haplotypes. These associations further emphasize the importance of genetic variation in innate immunity as determinants, not only of CD, but of UC as well.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota regulates key host functions. It is unknown whether modulation of the microbiota can affect a genetically determined host phenotype. Polymorphisms in the Nucleotide oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptor family confer genetic risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated whether the intestinal microbiota and the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium breve NCC2950 affect intestinal barrier function and responses to intestinal injury in Nod1(-/-); Nod2(-/-) mice.
METHODS: Specific pathogen-free (SPF) Nod1(-/-); Nod2(-/-) mice and mice gnotobiotically derived with altered Schaedler flora (ASF) biota were used. SPF Nod1(+/-); Nod2(+/-) littermates (generated by crossing SPF Nod1(-/-); Nod2(-/-) and germ-free C57BL/6 mice) and ASF Nod1(+/-); Nod2(+/-) mice were used as controls. SPF mice were gavaged daily with 10(9) -CFU B. breve for 14 days before colitis induction. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to assess microbiota composition. Intestinal permeability was assessed by in vitro and in vivo techniques. Expressions of epithelial apical junction proteins, mucin, and antimicrobial proteins were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence. Responses to intestinal injury were investigated using an acute experimental model of colitis.
RESULTS: Under SPF conditions, Nod1(-/-); Nod2(-/-) mice had increased paracellular permeability, decreased E-cadherin, and lower colonic antimicrobial RegIII-γ expression compared to Nod1(+/-); Nod2(+/-) littermate controls. These changes were associated with increased susceptibility to colitis. ASF colonization or B. breve supplementation normalized RegIII-γ expression and decreased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis in Nod1(-/-); Nod2(-/-) mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal microbiota influences colitis severity in Nod1(-/-); Nod2(-/-) mice. The results suggest that colonization strategies with defined commensals or exogenous specific probiotic therapy may prevent intestinal inflammation in a genetically predisposed host.},

	abstract = {Polymorphisms of interleukin (IL)-23R and signaling components are associated with several autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Similar to T helper type 17 (Th17) lineage, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) express retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (Rorγt) and IL-23R and hence, produce Th17-type cytokines. Recent reports implicated type 3 ILCs in IBD; however, how IL-23R signaling in these cells contributes to pathogenesis is unknown. IL-22, produced in copious amounts by type 3 ILCs, was reported to have both beneficial and pathogenic effects in adaptive, yet only a protective role in innate colitis models. Herein, by employing chronic CD45RB(high) CD4(+) T-cell transfer and anti-CD40 antibody-induced acute innate colitis models in Rag1(-/-) mice, we demonstrated opposite roles for IL-23R in colitogenesis: in the former a protective, and in the latter a pathogenic role. Furthermore, we show that IL-23R signaling promotes innate colitis via IL-22 as neutralization of IL-22 protected mice from colitis and adding back of IL-22 to IL-23R-deficient animals restored the disease. Collectively, our results reveal that similar to its controversial role during chronic or adaptive colitis, IL-22 may also have opposite roles in innate colitis pathogenesis in a context and insult-dependent manner.},
